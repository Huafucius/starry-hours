This repository now has two tracks:

1. **Awesome index**: a curated list of real, public skill repositories that clearly trace back to a specific **figure**, **book**, or **brand**.
2. **Skill factory prototypes**: in-repo skills under `skills/` that generate new distilled skills, starting with public-information figure skills.

No role-play packs, no catch-all bundles — only repos that extract a real **thinking framework** or **business logic**.

## 🧪 Repository Structure

### Part 1: Awesome index

- `README.md` / `README.en.md`
- Continuously curates external `xx.skill` repositories

### Part 2: In-repo skill factory

- `skills/create-figure-skill/`
  - A prototype skill whose job is to create new public-information figure skills
  - Uses a `source -> research -> distilled -> SKILL.md` pipeline
- `skills/luxun-perspective/`
  - A Lu Xun demo skill generated as the first end-to-end verification artifact

The current prototype only handles **figures**. Books and brands come later.

## 🌟 Featured

Repositories that clearly demonstrate a solid `source -> skill` distillation path:

- [HughYau/qiushi-skill](https://github.com/HughYau/qiushi-skill) — Distills problem-solving methods from Mao Zedong's works.
- [slavingia/skills](https://github.com/slavingia/skills) — Deconstructs a book into a set of callable commands, showcasing the `book -> skill` path.
- [JinGuYuan/jinguyuan-dumpling-skill](https://github.com/JinGuYuan/jinguyuan-dumpling-skill) — Turns a real-world restaurant into an MCP skill, demonstrating how physical brands enter the AI agent ecosystem.

## 📏 Selection Criteria

- **Real & Open**: Repositories must exist and be publicly accessible.
- **Clear Origin**: Entries must clearly correspond to **one or more specific people**, a **specific book**, or a **specific brand**.
- **Focus on Distillation**: The core value must be extracting frameworks and logic, not merely imitating tone or role-playing.
- We do not include generic targets (e.g., "Any Real Person") or broad skill packs that merely borrow a name; however, tightly scoped multi-person bundles are allowed when they enumerate a recognizable set of notable figures.

## 🤝 Contributing

PRs are welcome. Please ensure:

1. The repository is publicly accessible.
2. It falls under one of the three categories: Figures, Books, or Brands.
3. The name column contains **only exact names**; for multi-person bundles, list the most recognizable named figures explicitly.
4. The description clearly states what specific content was distilled, based on the repository's own README.
