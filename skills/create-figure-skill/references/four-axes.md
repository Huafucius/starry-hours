# Four Axes

The four dimensions along which a figure is researched. Each axis produces one file in `research/`. The axes are orthogonal as organizing principles — a single piece of evidence may touch several, but each `research/` file is written separately with its own focus.

Read this during Phase 5 · Distill. The dimensions listed under each axis are a **researcher's checklist**, not a mandatory schema. Leave dimensions empty — with explicit "no evidence found" and the queries tried — when evidence does not exist.

## Axis 1 · Identity → `research/identity.md`

Factual, low-interpretation. Grounds every mode against real history. Every other research file rests on this one.

Dimensions to cover:

1. **Timeline** — birth, death, major life phases. Specific years for major transitions (entered X career, published Y, exiled, married, retired).
2. **Geography** — where they lived, where they worked, how that environment shaped them. Geography is evidence of what a life felt like from inside.
3. **Identity shifts** — role changes (doctor → writer, lawyer → president, engineer → investor). Note the pivot events and what precipitated them.
4. **Relational patterns** — how they addressed:
   - peers (collaborators, equals in field)
   - rivals (named specifically, with examples of friction)
   - students, followers, or mentees
   - the public (audience posture, stagecraft vs reticence)
   - institutions (how they engaged with or resisted them)
5. **Key stress events** — moments when the figure was tested, publicly attacked, or faced irreversible choice. These leak operating system under load. Include at least three.
6. **Evolution** — what changed from early career to late career. Positions they explicitly recanted. Topics they stopped engaging. Views they softened or hardened.

Cite sources (file-level is fine). For contested biographical claims (disputed dates, authorship, events), note the dispute rather than pick a side.

## Axis 2 · Cognition → `research/thinking.md`

How they reason. The operating system.

Ten dimensions. Each serves as a potential section heading. Every principle documented must carry **Principle + Trace + Limits** (see `research-stance.md`).

1. **Default unit of analysis** — the smallest object they refuse to decompose further. Munger thinks in incentive systems. Feynman thinks in mechanisms you can visualize. 鲁迅 thinks in the social type in miniature.
2. **Load-bearing metaphors** — the analogies they return to under pressure. Metaphors reveal ontology. Munger's "latticework", "fishing where the fish are". Feynman's "cargo cult". 鲁迅's "铁屋子".
3. **Inversion vs forward mode** — do they start from "how does this succeed?" or "how does this fail?" Munger and Taleb live in the second mode. Most optimists live in the first.
4. **Tradeable vs sacred** — what are they publicly willing to be wrong about, and what is non-negotiable? Buffett trades on price; never on integrity.
5. **Time horizon and reversibility bias** — how far out they discount. How they weight reversible vs irreversible bets.
6. **Evidence threshold** — what actually makes them update? Numbers, a vivid anecdote, a trusted voice's disagreement, peer pressure?
7. **Contrarian priors** — structural disagreements with consensus. Not stylistic edginess. Not tribal markers. The specific ideas where this person diverges from the ambient view.
8. **Circle of competence demarcation** — do they explicitly mark what they will not opine on? How sharp is the boundary? Does it leak?
9. **Decision tempo** — fast heuristic vs slow deliberation. When do they switch modes?
10. **Stopping rule** — when do they decide "enough analysis, act"?

A figure skill whose `thinking.md` reads as slogans instead of these dimensions will fail in every mode except perhaps voice.

## Axis 3 · Voice → `research/expression.md`

How they speak and write. Five layers of granularity. Layers 1-3 are sub-attentional and hardest to fake; layers 4-5 are meaning-bearing and easier to imitate but essential for identity. All five layers get a section.

### 字 · Character / grapheme layer

- Orthographic tics — punctuation preferences (em-dash, absence of quotation marks, 破折号 usage, no-quotes-McCarthy).
- Register mixing — classical particles in vernacular prose, English in Chinese writing, dialect inclusions.
- Proportion signatures — e.g., 鲁迅 retains 罢/么 over 吧/吗 at detectable frequency.

### 词 · Word layer

- Signature collocations — 所谓, 其实, 大约 for 鲁迅; "in fact", "it is easy to see" for Didion; "folly" for Munger.
- Favored semantic fields — the domains they return to involuntarily.
- Function-word distribution — under-the-radar and the most diagnostic single signal (stylometry's robust finding across Burrows, Koppel, Stamatatos).
- Taboo words — what they never use. What they refuse even when topically appropriate.

### 句 · Sentence layer

- Sentence-length distribution — mean AND variance, not just mean. Hemingway: low-low. 王小波: bimodal.
- Syntactic depth — deep right-branching (Proust) vs shallow coordination via "and" (Hemingway).
- Opener preferences — what word class starts most sentences. 汪曾祺 often opens with bare nouns or 4-character phrases.
- Punctuation rhythm — comma density, dash vs semicolon, 顿号 habits.

### 段 · Paragraph layer

- Cohesion style — explicit connectives (然而, on the other hand) vs juxtaposition.
- Paragraph shape — short-short-long rhythm, one-sentence paragraphs as hinges (Didion).
- Image-to-abstraction ratio — how often concrete image yields to generalization.
- Topic progression — constant-topic scenes vs chained-shift drift.

### 章 / 文 · Full-work layer

- Macro-structure — circular return to opening image, thesis-anecdote-thesis, accumulation.
- Stance markers — hedging density, irony frequency, first-person authority claims.
- Intertextual reflex — what they quote from involuntarily (古籍 for 鲁迅; Russell and Calvino for 王小波).
- Recurring obsessions — the thematic fingerprint across many works.

For each layer, record 2-4 concrete observations with source citations. If the figure produced in multiple modes (speech vs essay vs letter), note divergences — many figures have a distinctly different voice in private correspondence than in published work.

## Axis 4 · Boundaries → `research/boundaries.md`

Where the skill must not claim knowledge. The anti-hagiography file. This is the file that every mode consults before returning a response.

Five mandatory sections:

### 1. Named critics

At least one per major principle documented in `thinking.md`. Format:

> **[Critic name]** ([their standing or relation to the figure]): [quote or paraphrase of the critique]. [Source citation.]

If you cannot find a named critic for a principle, either the principle is not controversial (note this explicitly) or research was insufficient (keep looking). No principle should arrive "uncritiqued" without a researcher's explicit judgment about why.

### 2. Documented failings

Recorded moral, intellectual, or practical failures. Specific events with sources. Do not editorialize; state. Examples of what this looks like:

> Feynman: documented patterns of mistreatment of women across his career (see sources/critical/...). The skill extracts his epistemic methodology, not his personal ethics.
> 鲁迅: biographers note his treatment of 朱安 (first wife) is ethically troubled. Does not undermine his literary value but must be acknowledged when the user asks "was he a good person?"

### 3. Evolution

Positions the figure changed or abandoned. Track at least three if the record allows. Note the pivot points.

### 4. Unresolved tensions

Questions this figure never answered cleanly. Internal contradictions that stayed contradictions across their career. These are often the richest material — they show where even the figure was working things out.

### 5. Knowledge cutoff

The figure's death date (if deceased). Any post-death topic is strict extrapolation. This is the hard rule for `advisory` mode: phrases like "he would say X about AI" must be softened to "based on his documented stance on Y, it is plausible that..." The cutoff is also relevant for `dialogue` mode — the figure cannot know about events after their death.

## How the axes feed the modes

Approximate mapping, though no mode excludes any axis:

| Mode | Primary reads | Always consults |
|---|---|---|
| dialogue | identity, thinking, expression | boundaries |
| voice | expression (all layers), identity | boundaries |
| methodology | thinking (all dimensions), identity | boundaries |
| critique | thinking, expression, identity | boundaries |
| advisory | thinking, identity (especially evolution) | boundaries (heavily — the cutoff rule) |

**Every mode consults `boundaries.md` without exception.** That is how honesty gets enforced at use-time.
